/// This type can be used to define important app properties,
/// and is also a namespace for KeyboardKit Pro app features.
///
/// You can create a static app value and add it to both the
/// main app target and its keyboard extension target, to be
/// able to easily refer to it from both targets:
///
/// ```swift
/// extension KeyboardApp {
///     static var keyboardKitDemo: Self {
///         .init(
///             name: "KeyboardKit",
///             licenseKey: "abc123",
///             bundleId: "com.keyboardkit.demo",
///             appGroupId: "group.com.keyboardkit.demo",
///             locales: [.english, .swedish, .persian],
///             deepLinks: .init(app: "keyboardkit://")
///         )
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The app value can also resolve other properties that you
/// may need, such as a ``dictationConfiguration``.
///
/// > Important: The ``locales`` collection is only meant to
/// describe which locales you *want* to use in your app. It
/// will be capped to the number of locales your KeyboardKit
/// Pro license includes.

    ///   - appGroupId: The app's App Group identifier, if any.
    ///   - locales: The locales to use in the app, by default `.all`.
    ///   - deepLinks: App-specific deep links, if any.
