/// perform dictation from a keyboard extension.
///
/// Since keyboard extensions can't access the microphone, a
/// keyboard dictation service must (unless it finds another
/// way not yet discovered) open its app and start dictation,
/// write the dictated result to shared state, then navigate
/// back to the keyboard and handle the result.
///
/// KeyboardKit doesn't have a standard dictation service as
/// it has for other services. Instead, a disabled dictation
/// service will be used until you setup KeyboardKit Pro, or
/// register a custom service.

/// See <doc:Dictation-Article> for more information.
///
/// > Note: The two dictation service types will probably be
/// merged in KeyboardKit 9.0.
