///
/// Simply call ``autocompleteSuggestions(for:)`` to perform
/// autocomplete and return suggestions for a provided text.
///
/// Words can be learned using ``learnWord(_:)`` and ignored
/// with ``ignoreWord(_:)``. Although it's up to the service,
/// learned words should be persisted and ignored words only
/// apply to the current service instance.
///
/// Not every service supports ignoring/learning words. Make
/// sure to check the ``canLearnWords`` and ``canIgnoreWords``
/// properties before exposing any such features to the user.
///
/// Once you have a list of suggestions, you can use them to
/// perform ``nextCharacterPredictions(forText:suggestions:)``
/// to predict which characters the user will type next.
///
/// KeyboardKit doesn't have a standard autocomplete service
/// as it has for other services. Instead, a disabled one is
/// used until you setup KeyboardKit Pro or a custom service.
